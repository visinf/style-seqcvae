        Extended Summary
        ----------------
        For a single training/evaluation instance, the image features remain the same from first
        time-step to maximum decoding steps. To keep a clean API, we use LRU cache -- which would
        maintain a cache of last 10 return values because on call signature, and not actually
        execute itself if it is called with the same image features seen at least once in last
        10 calls. This saves some computation.

        Parameters
        ----------
        image_features: torch.Tensor
            A tensor of shape ``(batch_size, num_boxes, image_feature_size)``. ``num_boxes`` for
            each instance in a batch might be different. Instances with lesser boxes are padded
            with zeros up to ``num_boxes``.

        Returns
        -------
        Tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]
            Averaged image features of shape ``(batch_size, image_feature_size)`` and a binary
            mask of shape ``(batch_size, num_boxes)`` which is zero for padded features.
