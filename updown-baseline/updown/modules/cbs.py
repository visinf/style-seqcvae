class ConstrainedBeamSearch(object):
    r"""
    Implements Constrained Beam Search for decoding the most likely sequences conditioned on a
    Finite State Machine with specified state transitions.

    .. note::

        We keep the method signatures as close to :class:`~allennlp.nn.beam_search.BeamSearch`
        as possible. Most of the docstring is adapted from AllenNLP, so thanks to them!

    Parameters
    ----------
    end_index : int
        The index of the ``@@BOUNDARY@@`` token in the target vocabulary.
    max_steps : int, optional (default = 20)
        The maximum number of decoding steps to take, i.e. the maximum length of the predicted
        sequences.
    beam_size : int, optional (default = 10)
        The width of the beam used for each "main state" in the Finite State Machine.
    per_node_beam_size : int, optional (default = beam_size)
        The maximum number of candidates to consider per node, at each step in the search.
        If not given, this just defaults to ``beam_size``. Setting this parameter
        to a number smaller than ``beam_size`` may give better results, as it can introduce
        more diversity into the search. See `Beam Search Strategies for Neural Machine Translation.

        r"""
        Given a starting state, a step function, and an FSM adjacency matrix, apply Constrained
        Beam Search to find most likely target sequences satisfying specified constraints in FSM.

        .. note::

            If your step function returns ``-inf`` for some log probabilities
            (like if you're using a masked log-softmax) then some of the "best"
            sequences returned may also have ``-inf`` log probability. Specifically
            this happens when the beam size is smaller than the number of actions
            with finite log probability (non-zero probability) returned by the step function.
            Therefore if you're using a mask you may want to check the results from ``search``
            and potentially discard sequences with non-finite log probability.

        Parameters
        ----------
        start_predictions : torch.Tensor
            A tensor containing the initial predictions with shape ``(batch_size, )``. These are
            usually just ``@@BOUNDARY@@`` token indices.
        start_state : ``Dict[str, torch.Tensor]``
            The initial state passed to the ``step`` function. Each value of the state dict
            should be a tensor of shape ``(batch_size, *)``, where ``*`` means any other
            number of dimensions.
        step : ``StepFunctionType``
            A function that is responsible for computing the next most likely tokens, given the
            current state and the predictions from the last time step. The function should accept
            two arguments. The first being a tensor of shape ``(group_size,)``, representing the
            index of the predicted tokens from the last time step, and the second being the
            current state. The ``group_size`` will be ``batch_size * beam_size * num_fsm_states``
            except in the initial step, for which it will just be ``batch_size``. The function is
            expected to return a tuple, where the first element is a tensor of shape
            ``(group_size, vocab_size)`` containing the log probabilities of the tokens for the
            next step, and the second element is the updated state. The tensor in the state should
            have shape ``(group_size, *)``, where ``*`` means any other number of dimensions.

        Returns
        -------
        Tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]
            Tuple of ``(predictions, log_probabilities)``, where ``predictions``
            has shape ``(batch_size, num_fsm_states, beam_size, max_steps)``
            and ``log_probabilities`` has shape ``(batch_size, num_fsm_states, beam_size)``.
