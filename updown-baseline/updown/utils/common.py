    A generator which yields a random batch from dataloader perpetually. This generator is
    used in the constructor.

    Extended Summary
    ----------------
    This is done so because we train for a fixed number of iterations, and do not have the
    notion of 'epochs'. Using ``itertools.cycle`` with dataloader is harmful and may cause
    unexpeced memory leaks.
